    "Markov decision problems (MDPs) are an important prelude to all reinforcement learning applications, as they define the task space of the application in question. These MDPs consist of a tuple ($\\mathcal{S}$, $\\mathcal{A}$, $\\mathcal{P}$, $r$), where:\n",

    "# Question 2: Simulating and Stabilizing Traffic in a Ring Road\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will consider the problem of stabilizing traffic in a straight highway while using a ring road network as a surrogate. The formation of traffic instabilities (often referred to as traffic congestion, stop-and-go traffic, traffic waves, etc.) in ring roads is a widely studied problem, as it is analytically tractable and has been empirically shown to generate similar instabilities in field studies (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wm-pZp_mi0)) as those witnessed in real network settings such as highways (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZC9h8jgSj4)). A thorough explanation of these instabilities is left until later in the course; instead here we are interested in reproducing them in simulation and we will build a few controllers to try to counteract these instabilities.\n",

To do so, we need a metric that tells you whether the weight vector is classifying things correctly. \n",

    "1. Generate a batch of 100000 data points of dimension two. For this data, compute the time to reduce the loss below .001 for batch sizes from 100 to a full batch in 10x increments. The full batch corresponds to normal gradient descent. Plot the batch-size vs. the time taken to convergence. Finally, in order to validate that your SGD operation is in fact converging to the right solution, print the normalized set of true hyper-plane parameters and the parameters you received in the 100 batch size case. **Warning**: do not recreate the data for each batch-size test as this can corrupt your results.\n",

    "**Hints**: \n",

    "- Make sure to keep the step-size the same across batches, otherwise your comparison is invalid.\n",
